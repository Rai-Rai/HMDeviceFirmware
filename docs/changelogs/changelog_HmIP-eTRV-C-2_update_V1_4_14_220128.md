Company:  Q-3, Maiburger Str. 29, 26789 Leer, Germany


Version 1.4.014 - 2022-01-28
--------------------------------------------------------------

* Bugfix
   * The time information telegram does not contain a note about the summer / winter
     time change.
      So it was possible that a time request to the access point in the period where the
      changeover from summer to winter time takes place could lead to a double
      changeover.
   * The device no longer heats correctly after a link to the WTH has been created.
      If the link between eTRV and WTH was deleted and then a new link was created, the
      devices only synchronized again after a restart (battery change) at the eTRV.
   * Correction for MANU set point temperature update after window open.
      If window open is detected (extern/intern) and during this time the device get the
      command "Eco-Mode", the device updated the set point temperature after window
      close and "Eco-Mode" off to the old set point temperature.
   * If the adaptation drive is faulty, it will not be repeated automatically.
      If the adaptation drive fails, it is first repeated automatically before being
      aborted with the corresponding error message
   * Stabilization of the adaptation drive.
      The adaptation drive failed by some valves, this was corrected.
