   * Piggyback ACKs are not evaluated accurately enough.
   * Offline alarming from Wired to Radio and Radio to Wired does not work
   * Output channels might be set to a wrong state after a long keypress command has received
   * If the switch-on and switch-off times in the Easy Profile are set to "Not active" at the same time, the device hangs up.

   * HmIP_APP: Send node confusion when using external send nodes
   * Answer-Frames are sometimes sent to the wrong IP destination

** Improvement
   * Long button press cannot dim in conjunction with a motion detector.
   * The time information telegram does not contain a note about the sommer / winter time change.
   * If possible, send multicasts only to PARTNER_ALL_WIRED_DEVICES instead of to PARTNER_ALL_DEVICES.
   * Modify event counter check to meet current specification

** Bugfix
   * If more than one status ACK frame is within the answer queue only the first one is send. Afterwards every new status ACK only triggers the last one
   * Statusinfo module creates status ACK telegrams with set ACK, ARR and Boot bits if this is the first status to be sent after startup
   * HmIP_APP: Send node confusion when using external send nodes
   * Sometimes Statusinfo uses old ApplicationSequenceNumber and Statusinfo with ACK get lost
   * Answer-Frames are sometimes sent to the wrong IP destination
   * Weekprogram doesn't work correctly if several virtual channels shall be triggered by one switching point
   * Profile: Buffer for learned links can overflow
   * If the link partner is known, an NAK is sent on ("invalid") frames without ARR bit
