---------------------

** Bugfix
	* [HMIP_SMI-35]: A configuration of the PIR_OPERATION_MODE now influences the internal state for "motion_detection_on"
	* [HMIP_SMI-53]: Backup mechanism also triggered with NAK from SNC / StatusInfoReceiver. 

** Modification
	* [HMIP_SMI-51]: New handling of event_counter in CndSwCmds implemented.

	* [HMIP_SMI-47]: A multicast telegram on the state reset channel (ch 2) caused a rx_stop forever and an increased current consumption. 



Version 1.4.4 - 20171023
---------------------

** Bugfix
	*[HMIP_SMI-39]: Double ack after a received SwCmd generated an undefined frame that was sent out
	*[HMIP_SMI-41]: Non Ack_Status weren't sent with rssi code "unknown"
	*[HMIP_SMI-42]: Blink duty cycle signal once and send status if duty cycle limit is exceeded (status too when limit is undershot)




Version 1.4.2 - 20170927
---------------------

** Bugfix
	*[HMIP_SMI-35]: A configuration of the PIR_OPERATION_MODE now influences the internal state for "motion_detection_on"
	*[HMIP_SMI-36]: Only accept SwCmds from linkpartners on channel 2 for StateReset (not on channel 1) 
	*[HMIP_SMI-37]: Discard a ConfigReqUpdate when ACK of a LinkPartner wasn't received, but let pass them when triggered by a keypress
	*[HMIP_SMI-38]:	A status request causes a StatusAck which include a filtered and a current brightness. 
			Other StatusAck's (i.e. after DirExStop) causes a StatusAck which includes only a filtered brightness. 



** New feature
	*[HMIP_SMI-27]: Send two brightness values in a status_ack (1. Brightness = filtered, 2. Brightness = current)
	*[HMIP_SMI-28]: Reset motion state with blocking period when a switch command is received on the new channel 2 (input)
	*[HMIP_SMI-32]:	Added parameter for disabling messages to the access controller
