   * If more than one status ACK frame is within the answer queue only the first one is send. Afterwards every new status ACK only triggers the last one
   * Statusinfo module creates status ACK telegrams with set ACK, ARR and Boot bits if this is the first status to be sent after startup
   * HmIP_APP: Send node confusion when using external send nodes
   * Sometimes Statusinfo uses old ApplicationSequenceNumber and Statusinfo with ACK get lost
   * Answer-Frames are sometimes sent to the wrong IP destination



Version 1.2.2 - 2018-08-14
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Bugfix
   * Real channel does not reach correct final slats position if more than one virtual channel is triggered at same time

   * If "Disable Message to AC" is activated and only one channel is addressed, no App-Ack is sent.
   * Direct Execution Commands without ARR bit are answered at application level
   * Homematic IP actuators trigger, due to the astro function, one hour delayed or prematurely on the day of the time changeover.
   * Divide maximum number of partners for virtual channels into individual values for virtual A, B and C
