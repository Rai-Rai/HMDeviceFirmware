Please note: Only use the firmware file in connection with the current software-version of the CCUx!
             If the switching actuator is operated in two-point control and the firmware version is 2.18.14, 
             we recommend to remove the batteries from the wall thermostat until the actuator update has been 
             successfully done. Otherwise the transmission of the firmware will be interrupted.
