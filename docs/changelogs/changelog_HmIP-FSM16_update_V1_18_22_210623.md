Please note: Only use the firmware file in connection with the current software-version of the CCUx!
             If the switching actuator is operated in two-point control and the firmware version is 1.18.14, 
             we recommend to remove the batteries from the wall thermostat until the actuator update has been 
             successfully done. Otherwise the transmission of the firmware will be interrupted.

--------------------------------------------------------------
** Bugfix
   * If possible, send multicasts only to PARTNER_ALL_WIRED_DEVICES instead of to PARTNER_ALL_DEVICES.
   * Device reboots if relay has to be switched
   * fixed bug in device behavior, if message to ac is disabled
   * fixed bug if factory reset is aborted
   * Fixed a bug in the zero crossing module due to new version of emlib

** Modification

Version 1 (2 for pluggable).14.4 -20190424 (Hotfix)
--------------------------------------------------------------
** Bugfix
   * PowerUpAction is executed although the parameters are not yet loaded.
   * If the switch-on and switch-off times in the Easy Profile are set to "Not active" at the same time, the device hangs up.
   * Modify event counter check to meet current specification


Version 1 (2 for pluggable).14.2 -20190311
--------------------------------------------------------------
** Bugfix
   * Modify event counter check to meet current specification
   * If the switch-on and switch-off times in the Easy Profile are set to "Not active" at the same time, the device hangs up. 
   * FSI16 switches relay to fast if mains power fails (not waiting min 200 ms) as the the ZCD detection without measuring IC produces IRQs
     only for positive half waves. Timer now has an interval of 20 ms, so the relay is switch only if 220 ms has elapsed.
