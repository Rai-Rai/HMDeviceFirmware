   * 1444094I
 
** Bugfix
   * If one link partner is unreachable the device goes to sleep directly 
     and is not waiting for app answers of other link partners

** Improvement
   * update HMOS to V1.20.3

Version 1.4.2 20161216
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094I
 
** Bugfix
   * HMOS now ignore stay awake bit for
     frames that are looped back internal
   * statusinfo frames are send with the "normal"sequence
     number ->
     after every status info frame the status info sequence
     counter is incremented, but the normal counter is put in
     the status frame. so every status info is send with the
     same sequence number as long no "normal" frame is send.
     The ACKs of the status info frames are not accepted as
     the sequence number of the ACK frame and the internal
     status info sequence number doesn't match

** Improvement
   * update HMOS to V1.18.2

Version 1.4.1 20160422
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094I
   
** Bugfix
   * Fixed bug that device waits arr timeout before signaling 
     tx status (red or green)
   * Device now accepts answers from SNC/HAP for switch commands


Version 1.4.0 20160329
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094I
   
** Modifications
   * Move project to Git
	 * Update HMOS to V1.16.0
	 * Bootloader is V1.8.0

Version 1.2.8 20160120
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094I
   
** Bugfix
   * If no link partner is available, a report link partner 
     problem frame is send. If a new kepress is detected 
     while the timeout for the link partner problem frame, 
     the device sends a config request after the timeout and 
     after the tx tries of the kepress.
   * The report link partner problem frame now includes a 
     link partner ip.

Version 1.2.7 20160118
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094I

** Bugfix
   * If the APPLICATION_cb_tx_UncndSwCmd
     has the state HMIP_MAC_STATUS_FAILED the sleep_delay is
     not set and the no further button presses are accepted.
     The LED does not stop blinking

** Modifications     
   * First cyclic interval event is not longer
     triggered directly after boot up, but after the minimum
     interval + random time.
     
Version 1.2.6 20160111
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094I
  
** Modifications     
   * Changed HMOS to version 1.12.1
   * Changed KRC4 to EFM32G210F128

Version 1.2.5 20151002
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094I

** Modifications     
   * Adapt the factory reset signalling 
     according to the changed specification.
   * The printf function calls are not removed if DEBUG_EFM 
     is not defined. The printf function is now called by a 
     DEBUG_PRINTF macro if DEBUG_EFM is defined otherwise the 
     macro is empty. Saves 3.5 k flash space.
   * Changed full rx timeout to a fix value of 1000 s for a 
     normal unconditional switch command due to the changes
     in the HMIP_APP_send_to_link_partners_async function.
   * Changed full rx timeout to a fix value of 45 s for 
     status info, config request and send link partner problem 
     to met the router timeouts.
   * Since HMIP_APP_send_to_link_partners_async sends now 
     always with ARR-bit the handling of long key presses has 
     changed. The FRAMES_create_unconditional_switch_command 
     no longer need to set the arr bit, this is done in the 
     application task.
   * set sleep delay to 0 if there is only one partner and it
     isn't available -> free the keys busy flag
   * Renamed APPLICATION_cb_tx_UncndSwCmd_multicast to
     APPLICATION_cb_tx_UncndSwCmd_unidirectional.
     
** Comments
   * Modified compiler settings for KRC4 so that they are the 
     same as for PBS2.  

Version 1.2.4 20150817
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094I
   
** Bugfix
   * If the time for partner communication 
     exceed 10 seconds (e.g. 20 burst partners which are not 
     reachable) the application go to sleep after arr timeout. 
     The sleep timeout is now set if after starting the 
     transmission and retriggered in the tx callback. The trx 
     is now initially set to full rx for arr + 1 seconds and 
     is retriggered in the tx callback with aar + 1 second.

   * The answer of the AC on a Request 
     Config Update is no handled by the application. This 
     causes that the device go to sleep after the reception 
     of the answer. By now the devices waits for ARR-Timeout.

** Modifications     
   * The application now sends a "report 
     link partner problem" frame if the partner has not been 
     reached(No MAC-ACK). A Config Request is only send if the 
     link partner answers with ANSWER_NAK_INVALID_CHANNEL or 
     ANSWER_NAK_PEER_UNKNOWN.
     
Version 1.2.3 20150724
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094I
   
** Modifications
   * modified testmode for the HMIP-KRC4

Version 1.2.2 20150701
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094I
   
** Bugfix
   * if the firmware is programmed to a new oder full erased controller, 
     the firmware hang up while loading the channel parameters. The 
     application and the key task always got a RETURN_BUSY from HMOS. 
     This error might be come up with the change to the HMOS lib. The 
     application and the key task now wait 10 ms between each call of 
     the PARAMETER_get_param_sequence_async function, this seems to help.
     

Version 1.2.1 20150623 (not released)
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094I
   
** Bugfix
   * The channels 3 and 4 of the KRC4 were not handled
     in the APPLICATION_validate_parameters_async function. So it returns 
     CALLBACK_FAILED and the stack sends a NAK.
     
Version 1.2.0 20150612
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094I
   
** Modification  
   * Changed to HMOS-LIB V1.10 
   
** Comments  
   * Added APPLICATION_emc_led_success due to changes in HMOS / Stack.
   * The Callback of the LED module has now an state and is called also
     if the led program is aborted by a new program. This might lead to
     failures in the device behaviour.   

Version 1.0.4 20150409
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094F
   
** Comments  
   * Increased Version number for OTAU testing.

Version 1.0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094F
   
** Modification  
   * Added support for request status frame

** Bugs
   * Corrected a bug with the sequence number check.
     

Version 1.0.0 20150320
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094F
   
** Modification  
   * Added support of MAC status HMIP_MAC_STATUS_OK_ROUTED (tx callbacks)
   * Changed Parameter ENABLE_ROUTING default value to 1 as the default 
     value in HMOS is 1 and the application now has to set the value 

** Bugs
   * Corrected the device behaviour if the Parameter LONG PRESS TIME is 
     0 (disabled)
     

Version 0.14.1 20150309
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094F
   
** Modification  
   * Changed behaviour if an link partner sends a NAK (only NAK peer unknown
     /invalid channel triggers a config request)
   * If a link partners sends no MAC ACK, this partner is removed from 
     temp-partner list and it is stored as if that partner sends a NAK peer 
     unknown. So the device don't have to wait the ARR-Timeout if no MAC-ACK
     received from partner

** Bugs
   * If the device is waiting for an answer and then gets config data, the 
     led signalling of the led signal "sending" is retriggered, if the 
     configuratin is done
   * Resolved following issue: 
     If the SNC is listed as link partner the Error-LED-Signal is 
     triggered even if the SNC sends an ACK.

Version 0.14.0 20150216
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094F
   
** Modification  
   * If the inclusion mode is retriggered, a inclusion request is send immidiately
   * If the factory reset procedure is terminated by a short key press of the key visual, the error led signal is started.
   * Production test implemented
   * Full RX timeout changed to 11 seconds (before 10s ). This caused sometimes a litte gap in the receive window.
   * Added additional operation mode DEVICE_MODE_PORTABLE_DEVICE

** Bugs
   * If a channel key is pressed within the factory reset procedure, the device starts to send switch commands. This makes it
     difficult to recognize the factory reset led signalling as it is overwritten by the tx attempts. Now the channel keys are
     not longer evaluated if the factory procedure has started.
     
     
Version 0.12.0 20150115
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094F
   
** Modification  
   * accept master key and local key for inclusion

Version 0.10.0 20141212
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Related Hardware
   * 1444094F
   
** Modification    
   * only Device local key is accepted
   * status info with bidi bit is send every hour   
   * Changed calculation of the parameter DUTY_LIMIT. The 
     parameter is now coded in 0.5% steps (1% steps before) 
     and 0xff means inactiv.
   * Changed the behaviour if a partner answers with 
     "peer unknown". If all partners have answered, whatever
     ACK or NAK, the LED signal is triggered (green or red).
     Till now the red LED signal were triggered after the rx 
     timeout, if at least one peer has send an NAK.  
   * unidirectional cyclic status info disabled by default 
     parameter value
   * Channel keys are only evaluated if the device is included
     -> no inclusion request on channel key stroke
   * After a service inclusion no further inclusion requests 
     should be send (same behaviour as after a normal
     inclusion).   
   * changed CSMA/CA status pin to the MISO pin
   
** New Feature
   * Added Parameter to List 1: REPEATED_LONG_KEYPRESS_TIMEOUT, 
     parameter index is 0x17. 
     After this timeout a long keypress triggers no further TX.
     Default Timeout is 2 minutes (0x82).
   * Low bat and very low bat behaviour implemented (orange led
     signal after tx, no further function if very low bat, ...)
   * Error led signal if inclusion has an error
   * Battery measurement on boot for very low bat detection 
   * The battery voltage is now an average value done by HMOS
   * Added support of the status info telegram with answer ACK.
   * Added signalling of an ongoing configuration 
   * Added sending of a StatusInfo on Boot.
** Bugs
   * modified the code that the first keypress of the key visual
     is not longer detected after more than 5 seconds (should be
     4 seconds)
   * Channelnumber in the request config update frame was wrong 
     if key visual was pressed
   * If the status receiver address includes 0x00 at any place
     no status info is sent
